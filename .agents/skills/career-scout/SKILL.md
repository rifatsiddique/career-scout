# career-scout — Router

## Mode Routing

Determine mode from `$mode`:

| Input | Mode |
|-------|------|
| (empty / no args) | `discovery` — show command menu |
| JD text or URL (no sub-command) | `evaluate` — auto-detected |
| `evaluate` | `evaluate` |
| `pipeline` | `pipeline-triage` |
| `setup` | `setup` |
| `cv` | `cv` (Phase 2) |
| `scan` or `scout` | `scan` |
| `interview-prep` | `interview-prep` |
| `deep` | `deep` |
| `auto` | `auto-pipeline` |
| `batch` | `batch` |
| `followup` | `followup` (Phase 5) |
| `port` or `import profile` | `port` |

**Auto-detection:** If `$mode` is not a known sub-command AND contains a job
posting URL (path segments: jobs/, careers/, posting/, opening/) or JD text
(keywords: "responsibilities", "requirements", "qualifications", "about the
role", "we're looking for"), route to `evaluate`.

If `$mode` is unrecognized and doesn't look like a JD or URL, show discovery.

## Discovery Mode (no arguments)

Show this menu:

```
career-scout — Command Center

  /career-scout [URL or JD text]   → Analyze this job — fit score, CV tips, interview prep
  /career-scout evaluate           → Analyze a job (same as pasting URL directly)
  /career-scout pipeline           → Review jobs in your queue (data/pipeline.md)
  /career-scout setup              → Set up your profile / update job types and targets
  /career-scout cv                 → Generate a tailored PDF resume for the last job you analyzed
  /career-scout cv --fast          → Quick editable draft (no PDF — for manual tweaks)

  /career-scout scan --import FILE    → Add jobs from a spreadsheet or CSV
  /career-scout scan --company NAME   → Search just one company
  /career-scout scan --clean          → Check for dead/expired job links right now

  /career-scout interview-prep <company> --tldr     → Print Pre-Flight Cheatsheet to terminal (10-min pre-call review)
  /career-scout interview-prep --bank-review        → Curate story bank — dedup, sharpen weak stories, upgrade schema
  /career-scout interview-prep --debrief <company>  → Post-interview capture — what was asked, what worked, lessons
  /career-scout deep <company>                      → Strategic company research — direction, culture, candidate angle

  /career-scout port              → Upgrading? Import CV, reports, story bank from a previous instance
  /career-scout port --dry-run    → Preview what would be imported (nothing is written)
  /career-scout port --groups 1,2 → Port only specific groups (core, pipeline, reports, etc.)

  /career-scout auto <url>          → Full hands-off pipeline: evaluate + CV + tracker update + pipeline move
  /career-scout auto <url> --docx  → Same, also generate DOCX
  /career-scout batch              → Process all pending jobs via parallel subagents
  /career-scout batch --dry-run    → Preview what batch would process (nothing executed)
  /career-scout batch --limit N    → Process only the first N pending jobs
  /career-scout batch --parallel N → Set concurrent worker count (default: 3)
  /career-scout batch --retry-failed → Re-run only jobs that errored (not un-started pending jobs)

Drop job URLs in data/inbox.txt → run /career-scout scan → /career-scout pipeline to review
```

## Context Loading by Mode

After routing, load the required files before executing:

### Modes that require `_shared.md` + their mode file

Read `modes/_shared.md` first, then `modes/{mode-file}`.

| Mode | Mode file |
|------|-----------|
| `evaluate` | `modes/evaluate.md` |
| `pipeline-triage` | `modes/pipeline-triage.md` |
| `cv` | `modes/cv.md` |
| `scan` | `modes/scan.md` |
| `auto-pipeline` | `modes/auto-pipeline.md` + `modes/evaluate.md` + `modes/cv.md` |
| `batch` | `modes/batch.md` |

### Standalone modes (mode file only)

Read only `modes/{mode-file}`.

| Mode | Mode file |
|------|-----------|
| `setup` | `modes/setup.md` |
| `interview-prep` | `modes/interview-prep.md` |
| `deep` | `modes/deep.md` |
| `followup` | `modes/followup.md` |
| `port` | `modes/port.md` |

### All modes: also read user data

Read `config/profile.yml` and `modes/_profile.md` as candidate context before
executing any mode. If either is missing or empty, prompt the user to run setup.
